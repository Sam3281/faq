## Notes:

### use "WIP" in the question title to denote a "Work In Progress" answer.

Let's mark any Q/As with `WIP` when the answer is long, complex, and likely to evolve over time. It is very important to signal when we think something is roughly "a final answer", versus "a place to jot down notes and point others for quick disambiguation". Many answers, like comparisons to other systems, will be WIPs for a while.
